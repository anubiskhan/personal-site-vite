                    Hi, I’m a software developer based in the Pacific Northwest with a passion for building, fixing, and optimizing systems. I thrive on creating efficient solutions and am particularly drawn to automation, seamless integrations, scalability, and crafting modular, maintainable designs.

                    <div>
                        <p>
                        Over the past six years, I’ve been deeply immersed in Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and AWS, developing robust, scalable applications.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I also bring a strong working knowledge of React, Python, DevOps, CloudOps, and project management, alongside experience in finance, economics, guitar, and carpentry.
                        </p>
